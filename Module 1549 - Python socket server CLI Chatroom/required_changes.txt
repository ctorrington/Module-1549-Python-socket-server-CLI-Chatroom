changes to comply with PEP8
    Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. 
    Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. 
    Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.
    - Make the package later

    Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
    The naming convention for functions may be used instead in cases where the interface is documented and used primarily as a callable.
    Note that there is a separate convention for builtin names: most builtin names are single words (or two words run together), with the CapWords convention used only for exception names and builtin constants.

    Because exceptions should be classes, the class naming convention applies here.
    However, you should use the suffix “Error” on your exception names (if the exception actually is an error).

    Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
    Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
    mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that’s already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.

    Multi-line docstrings consist of a summary line just like a one-line docstring, followed by a blank line, followed by a more elaborate description. 
    The summary line may be used by automatic indexing tools; it is important that it fits on one line and is separated from the rest of the docstring by a blank line
